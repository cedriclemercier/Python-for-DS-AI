# Python for DSAI

This is the repository for the course Python for DSAI at Asian Institute of Technology.

Some resource worth mentioning:

1. Prerequisites/0 - Reading Roadmap
  - For those who wants to know what papers to read.  I have listed ONLY the most important papers you need to read in the field of machine learning
2. Prerequisities/0 - Installation
  - For newbies who have trouble installing Python and other tools
3. Prerequisities/0 - Course Notations
  - Understanding notations is the first step towards conquering math, so take a look and familiarized with it
4. Syllabus/0. Course Introduction.ipynb
  - Contains how I run the course.  This course is a 15 weeks course, each week having two labs of 3 hours each.  Each lab always end with the assessment and solution.
  
I would also like to give credits to several githubs that I have revised to create this:

- https://github.com/drgona/Pytorch_bootcamp_Udemy
- https://github.com/SethHWeidman/DLFS_code
- https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook

I would also like to thank students who have contributed:

- Akraradet Sinsamersuk
- Pranisaa Charnparttarvanit
- Chanapa Pananookooln
